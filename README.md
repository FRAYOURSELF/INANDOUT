# Wayfarer Connect 🌍✈️

Welcome to Wayfarer Connect, your solution for bridging distances and connecting communities through the power of travel. 🌟

## What is Wayfarer Connect?

Imagine your college or community is far from the city, and you're in need of specific items available there. Person A is planning a trip to the city, and that's where Wayfarer Connect comes in. This app allows users to place orders for items from distant places. Travelers like person A, who are already heading to those locations, can choose to bring these requested items back.
